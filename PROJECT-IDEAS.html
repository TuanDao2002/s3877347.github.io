translator.”</strong> It is application that translates sign language into a meaningful word or sentence so that anyone without knowledge about sign language can understand and communicate. It will be a free website or mobile app so that anyone can have access to it. It will use the camera from a laptop or smartphone to record gestures and display their meaning by text on the screen or sound through the speaker so that the user can understand. The application’s memory size will be as small as possible, and all the data for the training model will be stored on cloud storage so that every device with limited memory storage can install it. &nbsp;

            <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Around 466 million people worldwide have disabling hearing loss, and 34 million of these are children (World Health Organization, n.d.). The large number of deaf and mute people in the world is a significant problem to society, so figuring out a way to improve the quality of their lives will benefit the community a lot. The sign language translator is a fascinating solution to this problem. It is an essential application for the disabled who are mute or deaf as it can help them communicate and have a better interaction with other people to integrate well with society. As sign language can be such a challenge for many people to learn and understand, this application can be an efficient way for someone who wants to study sign language and a useful tool for social workers to help the disabled in need.&nbsp;</span>

            <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">This application will appear as a website for laptops and PCs, or mobile apps for smartphones, including IOS and Android. In both cases, the user’s interface (UI) will be the same and user’s experience (UX) will not be much different. The user’s interface will include some components such as a recording screen that identifies the gesture, a displaying text that interprets the meaning of it, a filter that allows users to choose the type of sign language they want, a small status box to show whether the application can understand the gesture or not, a button links to an external website that teaches sign language.&nbsp;</span>

            <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">The functionality of the application will be simple. First, the users will open the application and allow it to use the camera from their smartphones or the webcam from their laptops or PCs. Because there are around 300 different sign languages in the world (United Nations, n.d.), so the users must choose the kind of sign language that they want to understand by clicking on the filter placed above the recording screen and keep scrolling until they found the language that they want. Then, point the camera toward the person who is describing a word using sign language, or place the webcam in front of him/her in case of laptops and PCs. The camera or webcam will record the gestures and display the meaning of them by text below the recording screen or by sound through the speaker if users click to the speaker’s icon placed at the bottom right of the recording screen. If the application can understand the gesture, a small status box at the bottom right next to speaker icon will turn blue, vice versa, it will turn red. There is also a button called “More” that directs the users to an external website that helps them to study many different kinds of sign language. &nbsp;</span>

            <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">In order to identify the gestures and match them to the specific meanings, the application will be integrated with a Machine Learning model. First, it is trained with a large number of images for each kind of gestures relating to each specific definition. Then, the model will test through every internal parameters of a modifiable algorithm and figure out the best ones which can give the most precise output. After that, the model will use the algorithm with the appropriate parameters to specify the pattern of each gesture and display the expectable result. The data set used for training the Machine Learning model will be stored on a cloud storage, so Internet connection is required to use the application properly. Some small features can be added in order to enhance the user’s experience (UX). For instance, a special forum will be an ideal place for the users to give some feedback about the accuracy and convenience of the application or just a community to share their knowledge, thoughts, and experience. This application can also be open source for individuals or organizations who want to explore and develop many more features or modify it to be suitable for their usage. &nbsp;</span>

              <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">In order to make the
application become not only user - friendly but also sophisticated enough to
display all the essential features, good frameworks and libraries are necessary
for the development of the application.<strong>&nbsp;React</strong>, an open -source JavaScript library supported by Facebook, is popular in developing websites due to its coverage with debugging and design tools. It provides React developers with informative warning and error messages and also helps to prevent code injections (DA14, 2017). This will help me save my time in developing the application with a high performing UI design. To make the application work appropriately on mobile environment, <strong>React Native</strong> will be my first priority. It is also open - source and a JavaScript framework with React library that aids developers in creating cross - platform mobile apps on every operating system including IOS and Android, so it is useful to create a smooth application on mobile devices. Cloud platforms that support AI training such as <strong>Amazon Web Service</strong> or <strong>Google
Cloud Platform</strong> will be tools for me create a competent Machine Learning model and I also can exploit the huge data set from them to train and improve my model better. <strong>Python&nbsp;</strong>is the main programming language used to create AI and<strong>&nbsp;OpenCV</strong> is a library that provides me with many programming functions allowing me to create the Machine Learning model that I want. They are indispensable tools for me to create an AI based application.

            <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">The
development of this application requires a set of special skills involving
exploiting frameworks such as React Native or libraries such as React, be
familiar with JavaScript, HTML, CSS to create a website or mobile app with a
competent interface. I can learn these skills at university or through online
tutorials. Many of them are popular on the Internet with detailed instructions.
I also need to have experience in setting up a Machine Learning model with
special algorithms to output the desirable results. It includes special skills
and knowledge about advanced programming and mathematics, which takes much time
to comprehend. Cloud computing’s skills are necessary to locate all of the data
set on cloud storage and use services offered by cloud platforms. There are
many online documents and tutorials for me to study them, but it is still quite
challenging and needs much effort to complete. </span>

the application is used widely, the disabled community will receive the most
benefit as they can better communicate with society and be more comfortable to
receive support from social organizations. Poor communication is a significant
drawback that negatively affects the literacy and the education of the disabled
community. Up to 80 percent of Deaf children worldwide never receive a formal
education (Deaf Bible Society, 2019). So, with the help of this application,
the disabled’s difficulties in having a formal education through proper
communication will be overcome, which will have a positive effect on their
individual future academic, professional, and social success. &nbsp;</span>
