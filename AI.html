            <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">&nbsp;(AI) refers to the simulation
of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and
mimic their actions (Frankenfield, 2020). The growth of this industry is on a
significant increase. In 2020, the global AI software market is expected to
grow approximately 54 percent year-on-year, reaching a forecast size of <a class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-2" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/607716/worldwide-artificial-intelligence-market-revenues/" target="_blank">22.6 billion U.S. dollars</a> (Liu, 2020). After seven decades of innovations and development, AI has become more and more efficient in analyzing data and solving complex problems, doing faster calculations and enhance its learning ability. AI currently achieves breakthroughs at computer vision, natural language processing, classifying voice and other types of non – textual data with high accuracy, making reliable predictions and decisions from recorded data, rebuilding images, music, and other data similar to given data, patterns detection and analysis.&nbsp;

The decision management system is widely implemented in the financial sector, the health care sector, trading, insurance sector, e-commerce, etc. (Gundavajyala, 2020). AI is also applied to develop robots and machines in analyzing data and performing complicated tasks without the help of human. It also can improve robots’ ability to have a complex communication with human or even express natural – like human emotional states, such as Sophia – a robot created by Hanson Robotics that can generate expressions of joy, grief, curiosity, confusion, contemplation, sorrow, frustration, among other feelings (Chung, 2018). AI is also popular in speech recognition to convert human speech into information that the computer can understand and analyze. Siri is an example of this, it will recognize your requirements through your voice and solve them or offer feasible solutions. AI - powered chatbots are implemented on many applications to help users interact better with them. Movie industry also exploits AI to create extraordinary scenes with spectacular effects that cannot be made in real life. One of the most remarkable examples is AI face changing used in the movie “Fast &amp; Furious 7” to reconstruct the faces of Paul Walker from many images of him and his brothers (WIMI, 2020).</p>

One of the most considerable one is the significant progress of Deep Reasoning. As reasoning requires a range of cognitive tasks such as basic common sense, adaptation to changing situations, simple planning and making complex decisions, it will be such a challenge for AI experts to build a system that can reason and think as human. However, with the development of large quantities of data and processing units, this will not be an out-of-range target and automate reasoning will appear in the near future. Incoming projects as self – driving cars and select professions are small progress that will actualize this innovation. Unsupervised learning is a promising development that may take place in the next few years. This is a training model with advantages toward supervised learning such as it does not require any extensive data and have a more practical processing method as human. This will revolutionize the processing speed, shorten the data volume required, and reduce human intervention to AI applications. Despite the exponential enhancement of processing units such as GPU and other hardware, the inefficient learning process is still a burden to the innovation and performance of AI application. So outstanding inventions in hardware development will be essential to the growth of AI application, such as neuromorphic chips or quantum computing systems, could factor into the new equation for AI innovation (IBM, n.d.). Moreover, blending AI to other recent technologies including Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Big Data, etc. will completely change the face of the world and have a major impact to society in the coming time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <h1>What is the likely impact?</h1>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">AI development will have a major impact to the
society in various ways. AI application will change the way corporations
organize their business models and help them to create more effective solutions
to response quickly to unexpected changing situations. For instance, Amazon
applied AI to their warehouse operations to determine how many units of a specific product it anticipates customers
to buy, which then factors into where the product is stocked so it is as close
as possible to the people who will buy it (Grasso, 2019). AI also has a
potential impact in medical area, especially in diagnosing illness for early
treatment. During the COVID – 19 pandemics, “the AI test correctly predicted the COVID-19 status of 92.3%
of patients coming to emergency departments at the John Radcliffe Hospital in
Oxford and the Horton General Hospital in Banbury during a two-week test period” (Lovell, 2020). Moreover, the incredible
processing ability of AI may help experts to create scientific breakthroughs in
many different fields. At the University of Chicago, researchers are using it
for everything from scanning the skies for supernovae to finding new drugs from
millions of potential combinations and developing a deeper understanding of the
complex phenomena underlying the Earth’s climate (Mitchum and Lerner, 2019). Many
works that require complex calculations and logic will be done with the help of
AI.
The growing of AI also means that jobs relating
to labor will be less and automation will be popular in the production lines.
Nevertheless, the demand for programmers who can install and create an AI
system will be on the increase. A 2019 report from Gartner shows that
enterprise applications for AI have grown 270% in four years, fueling a level
of demand that outstrips the current supply of qualified job candidates (Johnson,
2020). AI will change many people’s lives and many
occupations will be threatened due to the growth of it. For example, accountants
are likely to be redundant as many AI applications are able to complete many of
the works that they do such as monitoring documents, revenue, and even human
resources of enterprises. Autonomous production based on AI technology will not
only boost the productivity but also repair mistakes in the production process
so workers may be replaced by AI – based machines. Self – driving cars will
potentially become one of the most popular means of transportation in the
future, which also means that the demand for taxi drivers will no longer exist. &nbsp;</span>

          <h1>How will this affect me?</h1>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">The progress of AI will not only affect the
world but also each individual, including me. The development of AI technology
will be a fortune for me to exploit beneficial tools that can help me to deal
with my issues quickly and effectively, improve my work and social life. Siri
is an AI – assistant that can answer many of your questions and help you to
solve simple tasks such as making a call, playing a song, searching on the
Internet, etc. Due to its convenience and usefulness, I use it for many
occasions whenever I am busy or need emergent support. I also use Fandango – a
chatbot that give you advice on which popular movies should you watch as well
as the trailers of the upcoming movies, to help me save my time searching for
the appropriate movie to watch with my friends. Grammarly is an AI – powered
writing enhancement that aids me in creating an academic report with the least
number of spelling and grammar mistakes in a short time, a wonderful tool for
me to finish my assignment on time. If there are more AI applications that not
only solve my problems the way they did but also become better with greater
improvement, all my issues will be dealt at ease without so much effort. The
progress and popularity of AI will play a significant role in my family’s daily
life. The application of AI in healthcare will offer precious opportunities for
my parents to receive a decent caring and treatment that improves their health
quality. Smart home devices integrated with AI doing all of my housework in a
quick and effective way will help my family to have more time for relaxation
after a hard - working day. AI implemented in Amazon websites recommends my
family with appropriate products, which helps us to have a quick decision on
what to buy with a reasonable cost. Thanks to AI, our lives will be much easier
and more comfortable. &nbsp;</span>
