              <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Cloud computing</span></u>
            <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">&nbsp;is the delivery of different services through
the Internet. These resources include tools and applications like data storage,
servers, databases, networking, and software (Frankenfield, 2020). Although cloud computing is a fairly new
technology, its demand significantly increases and will have a major impact to
IT technology. “Over 95% of organizations are planning to
increase their cloud spends in the coming 12 months as the adoption of cloud
technologies has become vital”
(TechGig
Correspondent, 2020). With only a reliable Internet connection, cloud
computing allows us to store our information in a virtual space or cloud servers
without worries about the setup of any hardware or traditional hard disk
storage. But the most remarkable thing about it is that you can have access to
various software development’s services such as Software-as-a-service
(SaaS), Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)<strong>, Platform-as-a-service
(PaaS).</strong> Currently, Cloud computing is achieving many breakthroughs with greater data storage and the number of cloud servers distributed worldwide, make profound advancements in other relevant technologies such as AI by providing training models with countless valuable data set and tools. It also helps IoT devices to form better connections and generate useful data based on the patterns and habits of the users. The functionality of Microservices is enhanced with the help of Cloud computing due to its speedy, frequent, and guaranteed delivery of large, complex applications (James, 2020). Cloud computing also offers containers – a sort of operating systems virtualization to run many applications and microservices independently.&nbsp;

Businesses can also save their money on hiring technicians to install and manage their own servers, provide the flexibility of the services so many employees can work from home or from other field, extend the scale of their business model without the reconstruction of everything. In software engineering, Cloud computing play an important role in boosting the productivity and efficiency of software developers by providing special cloud tools such as GitHub, Amazon Web Service (AWS), etc. It also helps developers to collaborate better by supporting them to work together effectively. For instance, GitHub is a cloud platform that allows developers to share their source codes and modify them easily, they also can track the history of changes in their projects and they also can use it to host their projects. There are about 100 million repositories on GitHub, which indicates the enormous number of projects hosted there and how reliable it is (Warner, 2018). Cloud computing also show its usefulness in banking sector. The flexibility of Cloud computing enables the banking industry to adapt the ever – changing financial market, be always sustainable in every scenario. It is a safe and extensive data storage for the banking industry to utilize their data as well as their resources in a highly flexible and efficient manner. Cloud computing can help bankers to create a better system that can do thousands of transactions per day, reduce the required cost for infrastructure. According to the Australian banking major, its new private cloud environment, which is based on IBM Cloud technology, is expected to make development 10 times faster and three times cheaper (International Banker, 2018).</p>

Because information transferred through cloud must travel a far distance to the main server so there will be a considerable latency and a high risk of losing the and integrity of the data. A more improved form of Cloud computing – Edge computing will be a new trend in the future as it minimizes the latency of the transferred data and avoid violation from hackers by locating all the servers or mini data centers to local destinations near the users. It also offers greater bandwidth and relieve pressure on the main server. It is an ideal technology for IoT devices to create a large network of millions of devices. “Around 10% of enterprise-generated data is created and processed outside a traditional centralized data center or cloud. By 2022, Gartner predicts this figure will reach 75%” (Aktars, n.d.). Moreover, with the birth of the new generation of mobile network – 5G, the latency of the Cloud computing will be fixed, and performance of cloud services will be upgraded in an unexpected way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <h1>What is the likely impact?</h1>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">The
flexibility of Cloud computing will result in many positive changes in the
society, and one of the obvious one is remote working. As companies transfer
all of their business infrastructure to the cloud, the need to work together in
a particular place will become redundant as employees can finish their tasks
and share their works with colleagues via cloud services. During the COVID – 19
pandemics, cloud applications such as Slacks or Microsoft Teams are widely used
for real – time communications throughout an entire organization (Deramus,
2020). As cloud storage has an unlimited storage capability, other types of
storage such as hard disks, USB, etc. will be no longer important as users will
tend to store their data on cloud. The popularity of Cloud computing will not
only change the face of IT industry but also affects the way people interact
with software applications. Cloud applications will be a trend in the future.
With its advantage of being installed and used on every device without
downloading, Cloud application will replace traditional one and become the
future of software development. The application of Cloud computing in AI
industry will result in more effective and easier – to – make AI applications.
For instance, a cloud – based tool created by Google called Teachable Machine lets you train your own machine learning model
with the click of a button, no coding required, and export it to websites,
apps, physical machines and more (Phillips, 2019). 
Cloud
computing will have a considerable impact to many aspects of the society in
various ways. Online teaching with the help of Cloud computing will be common in
the future, which requires teachers to adapt this change and modify their
teaching methods. Cloud computing has a necessary effect on the way managers
monitor their companies and organizations, so they need to have some basic
skills in using cloud services to be more competitive in the business industry.
Jobs relating to cloud computing will witness an upward trend in the coming
years, as “81 percent of
enterprises already have a multi-cloud strategy in place” (Wilczek, 2018). &nbsp;</span>

          <h1>How will this affect me?</h1>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Cloud applications are very popular in our
daily lives and we may not imagine what our lives would be without them such as
Google Drive, Dropbox, Facebook. The positive changes in Cloud industry will
offer me an opportunity to own more effective and powerful tools improve my
work’s productivity and my social life. When the capability of cloud storage
increases, I will have more free space to store my essential files and
documents without worry about the size of physical memory storage. Amazon Web
Service (AWS) is a perfect environment for developers to deploy and develop
their software effectively at the lowest cost. The extension and development of
it will bring benefits to many IT professionals and it will be a useful tool
for me in the future. The improvement of cloud services means that texting
applications such as Messenger, Snapchat, etc. will have better performance so
it will be more comfortable for me and my friends to communicate with each
other. The upgrade of cloud sharing services such as iCloud will allow me to
share more images and memories with my friends. Because “without cloud storage systems, social networks
could not keep up with demand” (The Digital Age, 2018), so social network applications exploiting the advantages of Cloud
computing such as Facebook will be on the increase and it will enhance my
experience in using them. Data management by cloud services applied in
healthcare will be useful for the elderly as my grandparents to keep track of
their health records. The popularity of cloud – based online teaching
applications bring many benefits to me and my family as we can work at home and
save our time traveling to far places. By that, we will spend more time on
ourselves and with each other. &nbsp;</span>
